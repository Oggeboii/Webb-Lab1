            <h1>Reroute to Remain</h1>
                <p>Reroute to Remain (subtitled: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Insanity, and on reissue: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Madness) is the sixth studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released in September 2002. 
                    The album saw a major change in musical style and was met with rejection among many of the band's fanbase. 
                    The album's more accessible sound attracted many new fans and popularized In Flames' name within the American heavy metal scene, helping to secure a top spot at Ozzfest. 
                    It was the band's first album to present singles: "Trigger" and "Cloud Connected". 
                    The band would continue to use guitars tuned to Drop A# on this album with some songs tuned to C standard, with the exception of "Transparent", which was tuned down to Drop G.
