            <h1>Clayman</h1>
                <p>Clayman is the fifth studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released via Nuclear Blast on 3 July 2000. 
                    It has a dark theme, with most of the lyrics dealing with depression and internal struggles. 
                    Clayman is the final In Flames album to feature their original melodic death metal sound. 
                    The band would later start to experiment with other styles on their next release, Reroute to Remain, gradually progressing these more experimental elements across their future releases later into the 2000s. 
                    Like on some songs on the previous album Colony the band tuned their guitars to drop A# on the songs Pinball Map and ...As the Future Repeats Today. 
                    The album's cover art is based on Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man drawing. 
                    The Jester Head appears in the background, both on the cover, and in the album booklet itself. 
                    Music videos were produced for the songs "Pinball Map" (directed by Tamara Jordan) and "Only for the Weak".
