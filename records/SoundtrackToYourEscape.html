            <h1>Soundtrack to Your Escape</h1>
                <p>Soundtrack to Your Escape is the seventh studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released on 29 March 2004. 
                    The album was criticized by longtime fans because of a major change in musical style. 
                    However, the album was seen by many as a natural progression from Reroute to Remain and was critically praised by critics such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang!. 
                    It reached number 3 in Sweden, number 45 on the American Billboard 200 chart (the band's first album to reach the Billboard 200), number 2 on the Top Heatseekers chart, and number 7 on the Independent Albums chart. 
                    This would mark the first album where the band would exclusively use drop A# tuning and abandoning the C standard tuning of previous albums.
