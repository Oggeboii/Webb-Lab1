            <h1>The Jester Race</h1>
                <p>The Jester Race is the second studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released in February 1996. 
                    It is the first album to feature Anders Fridén as the band's vocalist, Björn Gelotte as the drummer, and Jester Head as the band's mascot. 
                    The album was the band's second full-length album released following the more mainstream success of their 1995 EP, Subterranean. 
                    The Jester Race was recorded at Studio Fredman by Fredrik Nordström, who also contributed keyboards for the album. 
                    The song "Dead Eternity" was originally on the Subterranean (EP) and the song "Dead God in Me" was also originally on the Subterranean (EP) but with a different title, "The Inborn Lifeless". 
                    Although, the version on The Jester Race has different lyrics, a different ending, and a slightly different solo.
