            <h1>Lunar Strain</h1>
                <p>Lunar Strain is the debut studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released in April 1994. 
                    The album is known for its "folky elements", with the inclusion of violins and acoustic guitars along with influences from black metal. 
                    It is the only In Flames album to not feature Anders Fridén as the vocalist and Björn Gelotte as either drummer or lead guitarist. 
                    Guitarist Jesper Strömblad plays the drums, while the vocals are sung by Dark Tranquillity vocalist Mikael Stanne, a session musician for In Flames at the time. 
                    Stanne had sung with the band previously on "Demo '93". 
                    Coincidentally, Fridén was the original vocalist for Dark Tranquillity and he effectively traded places with Stanne in 1995. 
                    By 2010, all band members who participated in the recording of Lunar Strain had left In Flames.
